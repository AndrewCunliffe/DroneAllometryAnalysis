or defense of any claim or litigation to which this indemnification 
applies. You agree to cooperate with 123RF in the defense of any such 
claim and shall have the right to participate in any litigation at your 
own expense. 123RF shall not be liable for any legal fees and/or other 
costs incurred prior to receiving complete notification of the claim as 
provided herein.</p></li>
		<br>
		<li><b> No modification</b><br><br>
		<p style="padding:0;"> Notwithstanding anything to the contrary 
contained herein, 123RF shall not be liable for any damages, costs or 
losses arising as a result of Edits, Synchronizations, Reproductions, 
modifications or alterations made to the Audio Content or the context in
 which the Audio Content are used by You.</p></li>
		<br>
		<li><b>Liability Cap</b><br><br> 
		<p style="padding:0;">123RF's maximum aggregate obligation and

		<br>
		<li><b>Entire Agreement and Governing Law</b><br><br>
		<p style="padding:0;"> This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement
 between You and 123RF regarding its subject matter until superseded and
 substituted by any Update(s). Should any provision of this Agreement be
 held to be void or invalid, that fact will not affect any other 
provision, and the remainder of this Agreement will be construed to most
 closely give effect to the parties' intention. Failure by 123RF to 
enforce any provision of this Agreement will not be deemed a waiver of 
future enforcement of that or any other provision. The interpretation 
and enforcement of this Agreement shall be governed according to 
international treaty provisions and other applicable laws.</p></li>
		<br>
		<li><b>Termination</b><br><br>
		<p style="padding:0;"> This Agreement is effective until it is 
terminated. You can terminate this Agreement by (i) deleting and 
destroying all Audio Content downloaded by You and in Your possession, 
and any Licensed Work(s), and copies/accompanying materials thereof; and
 (ii) ceasing to use the Audio Content for any purpose. 123RF can 
terminate this Agreement without notice to You if You fail to comply 
with any of the terms and conditions of the Agreement. Upon such 
termination, you must immediately (i) delete and destroy all Audio 
Content downloaded by You and in Your possession, and any Licensed 
Work(s), and copies/accompanying materials thereof; (ii) cease using the
 Audio Content for any purpose; and (iii) confirm in writing to 123RF 
that the foregoing requirements have been completed.</p></li>
		<br>
		<li><b>Assignment</b><br><br>
		<p style="padding:0;"> Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in 
this Agreement, neither party shall assign its rights or interests under
 this Agreement to any third party without the other party's prior 
written consent in each instance; except that a party may assign its 
rights, interests and obligations hereunder to any similarly financially
 responsible entity that is either (i) an affiliate of such party, (ii) 
the surviving entity of a merger, consolidation, restructuring plan or 
reorganization in which it participates, or (iii) to the purchaser of 
all or a majority of all the assets of the party, provided such assignee
 agrees to assume in writing such party's rights and obligations under 
this Agreement.</p></li>
		<br>
		<li><b>Prevailing Language</b><br><br>
		<p style="padding:0;"> This Agreement was originally composed in 
English and was subsequently translated into other languages. The 
fidelity of subsequent translations cannot be guaranteed. In case of 
conflict between the English version and another language version, the 
English version takes precedence. </p></li>
		<br>
		<li><b>Right of Third Parties</b><br><br>
		<p style="padding:0;"> Any person or entity who is not a party to this
 Agreement (whether or not such person shall be named, referred to, or 
otherwise identified, or shall form part of a class of persons so named,

whatsoever to enforce this Agreement or any of its terms. </p></li>
